3. In Amazon S3 website, create bucket and upload photo file in the bucket. Or you can upload photo from your Python command.
4. Detect the photo uploaded using boto3 package and json package.


`
import boto3
import json
s3=boto3.resource('s3')
for bucket in s3.buckets.all():
      print(bucket.name)
data = open('file name', 'rb')
s3.Bucket('bucket name').put_object(Key='test.jpg', Body=data)
if ___name___ == "__main__":
        photo='file name'
        bucket='bucket name'
        client=boto3.client('rekognition')

        response = client.detect_faces(Image={'S3Object':{'Bucket':bucket,'Name':photo}},Attributes=['ALL'])

        print('Detected faces for ' + photo)    
        for faceDetail in response['FaceDetails']:
              print('The detected face is between ' + str(faceDetail['AgeRange']['Low']) 
              + ' and ' + str(faceDetail['AgeRange']['High']) + ' years old')
              print('Here are the other attributes:')
              `print(json.dumps(faceDetail,` indent=4, sort_keys=True))
